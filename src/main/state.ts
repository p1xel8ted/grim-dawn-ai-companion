/**
 * The window's session: one settings object, one database, one snapshot.

 * ceremony. What it does owe the rest of the app is *honest invalidation*:
 * changing the game directory or the locale invalidates the database and every
 * icon derived from it, while changing character or difficulty invalidates only
 * the snapshot. Getting that backwards means either a stale window or a
 * thirty-second rebuild on a dropdown change.
