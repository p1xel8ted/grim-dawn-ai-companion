/**
 * One advice run at a time, owned by the main process.
 *
 * The run lives here rather than in the renderer for a reason that is specific
 * to how long it takes: a real call is **~500 seconds**. Over eight minutes a
 * renderer can be reloaded, hot-replaced, or simply left behind by a window the
 * user resized into a busy frame — and every one of those would abandon a call
 * that is already being paid for. Started in main, the subprocess outlives all
 * of it, and a freshly-mounted renderer re-attaches through `status()`.
 *
 * Progress is **honest phases, elapsed time, and whatever the backend will tell
 * us — never a percentage.** There is still no way to know how far through an
 * opaque call is, so a bar would be an invention; the phases (`context` →
 * `asking` → `repair`) are the three things that genuinely happen and the clock
 * is real. What has changed since the first draft of this file is that the
 * backend turned out to have more to say: a streaming provider reports the
 * reasoning and the answer as they are written, which is the difference between
 * "asking the model" for ten silent minutes and watching it work through the
 * loadout. Coalesced here rather than forwarded raw — the deltas arrive dozens of
 * times a second, which is far more often than a panel can be read or repainted.
 *
 * A second `start` while one is live is refused rather than queued. Two
 * concurrent runs would cost two runs and, worse, the second would finish
 * against a document the first has already made stale.
