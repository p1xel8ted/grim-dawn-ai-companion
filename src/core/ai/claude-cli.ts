/**
 * The default advisor backend: the user's own `claude` CLI, which carries their
 * subscription OAuth in the keychain. No API key, no network code here — one
 * subprocess, the document on stdin, a JSON envelope on stdout.
 *
 * The invocation is pinned deliberately:
 *
 * - `--model` and `--effort` are always passed. Without them the subprocess
 *   inherits whatever the user's interactive session or settings happen to say,
 *   which makes two runs of `advise` on the same save silently incomparable.
 * - The document goes over **stdin**: at ~36k tokens it is far past ARG_MAX.
 * - The persona goes in a **file**, via `--system-prompt-file`. Passed inline it
 *   was ~33k characters against a Windows command line that stops at 32,767
 *   including the executable path, so `prompt.ts` growing by a paragraph turned
 *   every run into `spawn ENAMETOOLONG`. Nothing on this command line may grow
 *   with the persona, the dossier or the question again; `test/ai.test.ts`
 *   checks that for both backends, because scoping the same fix to codex alone
 *   is how it happened here a second time.
 * - `--tools ""` makes this a pure one-shot completion; `--no-session-persistence`
 *   keeps it out of the user's session history.
 * - `cwd` is the temp directory, so the subprocess does not pick up this repo's
 *   CLAUDE.md or any other project context.
 * - **Never `--bare`** — it disables exactly the OAuth/keychain auth this depends on.
