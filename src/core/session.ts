/**
 * One character, loaded end to end.
 *
 * Picking a character, reading its `player.gdc` and the three account-wide
 * `.gst` files, resolving, aggregating and compiling the context document is a
 * single composition that both the CLI and the Electron main process need, and
 * it is the composition that must not drift: the document the UI shows and the
 * document the advisor is sent have to be the same document, built the same
 * way, or Stage 7B's advice-to-item join stops meaning anything.
 *
 * Failures are typed rather than printed. The CLI turns a `SessionError` into a
 * one-line message and exits; the window shows it in the frame it already has
 * open. Neither behaviour belongs down here.

 * composition, no drift. With it excluded, the stored items are removed from the
 * *resolved walk* and the document rebuilt, which takes the stashes out of every
 * section at once: §7 stops ranking their gear, §8 stops counting components
 * installed in it, §12 stops costing thresholds against it. The materials store
 * is not a stash and always stays — it is the component census.
 *
 * The snapshot itself is never filtered: it also feeds the window, and a
 * preference about what the *model* reads must not make items vanish from the
 * screen. The ids still join across the two documents, because an item's id is a
 * hash of the item itself, not of its position in the list — the only wobble is
 * the disambiguating suffix on byte-identical duplicates, which can shift a mark
 * between two copies of the same thing.
 *
 * This is also the one place the **candidate projections** are switched on:
 * the document the model reads carries the projected swap under every §7
 * candidate, and the snapshot's own document (built on every watcher tick)
 * does not. So the stash-included branch rebuilds too — every existing line
 * comes out byte-identical, the ids being hashes of the items — and the result
 * is memoised per snapshot, because the context viewer and the run both ask
 * for it and a hundred aggregates need not run twice.
