/**
 * Current gear beside proposed gear, slot by slot.
 *
 * This replaces the in-game paper doll on purpose. The doll's arrangement
 * exists to wrap a rendered character, and there is no character here — what is
 * left is a lot of empty middle and no room for the one thing the tool is for,
 * which is comparing what you are wearing against what you could be. So each
 * slot is a row: what is equipped, an arrow, and what the advisor proposes.
 *
 * Until an advice run exists the right-hand side is locked rather than hidden.
 * An empty column that is obviously waiting for something says what the app
 * does; a column that is not there says nothing at all.
 *
 * The proposal is not always a different item. Four of the seven verdicts keep
 * the item and change what it *carries* — a new component, a different augment.
 * Those render as **the same item again**, with the new socketable in its
 * socket and the consequences in its tooltip, because that is what the slot
 * will actually look like afterwards: the reader is comparing two states of one
 * item, and showing them a lone component asks them to do that assembly in
 * their head.
