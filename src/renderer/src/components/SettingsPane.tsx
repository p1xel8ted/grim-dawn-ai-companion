 * Settings — the real `Settings` schema, edited in place.

 * Two rules run through it. **Every field writes the same settings file the CLI
 * reads**, so a preference set here and a run started from a terminal cannot
 * disagree; and **a path is typed or picked, never only guessed**. Detection is
 * good on the machines it knows (Steam under CrossOver, GOG under `GOG Games`,
 * a native Windows install) and useless on the ones it does not, so the found
 * paths are offered as a list beside a text field that always accepts an
 * arbitrary one.
 *
 * Text fields commit on blur or Enter rather than per keystroke: `gameDir` and
 * `locale` each drop the item database, and rebuilding it once per character
 * typed into a path is half a minute of work per letter.
