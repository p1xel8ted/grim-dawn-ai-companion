/**
 * The saves the tests run against.
 *
 * The user's real saves are the only fixtures that prove these parsers against
 * the actual game version — but they are also *live*: played, respecced,
 * re-geared and deleted between runs. So each one is copied into git-ignored
 * `test/fixtures/` the first time it is asked for, and every test reads that
 * copy from then on. The install is consulted once; after that the suite is
 * stable no matter what happens in game.
 *
 * Nothing here is committed. Saves are game-derived data and stay out of the
 * repo, which is why the fixtures are built on the machine that has them rather
 * than shipped, and why the roster is discovered rather than written down.
 *
 * Path resolution itself lives in `@grimdawn/core/paths` (and honours `GD_SAVE_DIR`),
 * so the tests exercise the same lookup the CLI uses rather than a parallel copy.

 * The characters the tests run against: **snapshots, not live saves.**
 *
 * A test that reads `save/main/<name>/player.gdc` is a test whose subject the
 * user can respec, re-gear or delete between runs, and both failure modes have
 * happened here. The roster was hardcoded as `['_Suchka', '_abcdef']`;
 * `_abcdef` was deleted in game, `haveSaves()` went false, and forty-one live
 * tests began skipping *silently* — a skip being exactly what a machine without
 * the game is supposed to report. The ones still running then failed on a
 * character that had been respecced out of the mastery they named.
 *
 * So the live tree is read exactly once per fixture: `snapshot()` copies a save
 * into git-ignored `test/fixtures/` the first time it is asked for, and every
 * test reads the copy forever after. A fixture whose character no longer exists
 * keeps working — `_abcdef` is still a test subject months after being deleted —
 * and playing the game cannot move an assertion.
 *
 * Nothing here is committed: saves are game-derived data. Which is why the
 * roster is still *discovered* rather than written down — on a machine with no
 * fixtures yet, it is whatever that install has, and tests that need a
 * character of a particular shape look for one (`characterWith`,
 * `primaryCharacter`) instead of naming it.
