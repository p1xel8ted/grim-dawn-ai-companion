/**
 * The main process's run manager.
 *
 * `src/main/advise.ts` imports nothing from Electron, which is what lets the
 * hardest half of Stage 7B be tested here rather than by clicking a window:
 * cancellation, a refused second run, a dead backend, and the fact that a run
 * survives a renderer that goes away mid-call. All of those are *timing*, and
 * none of them can be exercised against a real eight-minute subprocess — so the
 * provider is injected, exactly as `claude-cli` injects its `spawn`.
 *
 * The character, though, is the live save: `planCheckInput` verifies a plan
 * against what the document actually offered, and a stubbed dossier would test a
 * document nothing produces.
